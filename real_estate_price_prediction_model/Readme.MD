# Real Estate Price Prediction Model
This data science project walks through a step by step procedure of how to build a real estate price prediction model. The model took the banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. I used sklearn and linear regression to build the model. During model building i covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 

# Technology and tools that this model covered

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Google Colab as IDE

Thanks to codebasics to help me throughout the project.
