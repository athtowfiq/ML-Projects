# Dhaka House Rent Prediction
The data used in this project was collected from some famouse house rent and house selling websites.This work is very unique in Bangladesh. We submitted this project and it's papers to some National and Internationl conference and journel. The result is still on process as the work is very recently done. I used sklearn and linear regression to build the model. During model building I covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 

# Technology and tools that this model covered

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Google Colab as IDE



Thank you
